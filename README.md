**NOTE:** If you fork or re-use this project, please be sure you:

* Edit _includes/analytics.html and either
  * Replace the Google Analytics tracking code with your own, or
  * If you don't use Google Analytics, comment the block of code out entirely.

Otherwise I will receive GA data from your website.
