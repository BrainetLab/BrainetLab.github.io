  fulldescription: '
  FAGSO is an agglomerative Surprise Optimization algorithm written in C++ with bindings as MEX MATLAB and Octave file as well as Python library. It comes as the first proof of concept implementation of the idea, and accompanies the paper *Modular structure of brain functional connectivity: breaking the resolution limit by Surprise*.

  description: Partitioning Cost Optimization
  fulldescription: '
  PACO is the second iteration of the FAGSO algorithm, written from scratch with better data structures implementation as well as the full support of the igraph library.
  PACO implements agglomerative optimization methods as well as simulated annealing, and its written in a modular fashion so optimization of cost funcitons of various type can be carried on in a series of subsequent steps.

  fulldescription: '
  CommunityAlg is a set of Matlab functions for the analysis of complex networks and it extends largely the Brain connectivity Toolbox (BCT) by Sporns and Rubinov. CommunityAlg at the moment is a moving target and the implementations of the methods may change in the future as well as their signatures.'

  description: A Matlab wrapper around the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark network generator
  github: https://github.com/carlonicolini/lfrwmx
  fulldescription: LFR is an implementations of the planted partition model where the degrees and the community size is modeled after powerlaws with specific exponents. This implementation is a Matlab wrapper around the LFR Weighted with non overlapping communities that is available on the website of Santo Fortunato.
