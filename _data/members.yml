  description: 'Angelo Bifone received a University degree from the University of Rome (Italy) in 1990, and a doctoral degree in Physics from the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa (Italy) in 1995. He conducted postdoctoral research in Berkeley (CA, USA) and Leiden (The Netherlands). From 1996 until 2001 he held the position of Lecturer in Magnetic Resonance Physics at the Institute of Cancer research of the University of London (UK). From 2001 until 2010 he was the director of the Neuroimaging Department of the Glaxo-Smith Kline Medicines Research Center in Verona (Italy). In 2010 he joined the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia as a Tenured Senior Scientist and Director of the Center for Neuroscience and Cognitive Systems. Angelo Bifone expertise is in the area of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging as applied to the study of brain function and disfunction. His group has pioneered pharmacological MRI methods to study the effects of drug intervention on brain functional activity and connectivity. His current research interests include the study of brain connectivity using graph representation and complex network analysis. Angelo Bifone published ca. 100 peer-reviewed papers in top-tier international journals, including Neuron, Nature Neuroscience and PNAS; he was awarded the Sapio Prize for MRI in 2004.'

From a computer science background, her main research interest since her PhD (in 2006) concerned the neural basis of multisensory integration. She  has  used  several  non invasive  brain  imaging to investigate these  processes  in  the  human  brain and specialized in developing toolbox to analyse fMRI (retinotopy, bMode intersubject synchronization...). Recently, her interest has been oriented to functional connectivity in resting state and a possible disruption of it in people presenting connectopathies (Schizophrenia, Drug addiction)'
