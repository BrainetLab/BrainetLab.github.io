  After completing his undergraduate studies in Physics at the University of Rome, he earned a PhD in Physics from the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa and a Master in Business Administration from Alma Graduate School, University of Bologna. His career includes stints in academia and in industry R&D. He worked as a PostDoc at the University of Berkeley (California) and at the University of Leiden (The Netherlands). From 1996 to 2001 he was  a Lecturer at the Institute of Cancer Research (UK), where he obtained the status of Teacher of the University of London. For 9 years he headed the Neuroimaging Department of the Medicines Research Center of Glaxo Smith-Kline, a large research-based pharmaceutical company, in Verona, Italy. In 2010 he joined the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, where he took roles of increasing responsibility.'

  description: '
From a computer science background, my main research interest since my PhD (in 2006) concerns the neural basis of multisensory integration. I  have  used  several  non invasive  brain  imaging to investigate these  processes  in  the  human  brain and specialized in developing toolbox to analyse fMRI ( retinotopy, bMode intersubject synchronization...). Recently, my interest has been oriented to functional connectivity in resting state and a possible disruption of it in people presenting connectopathies (Schizophrenia, Drug addiction...)'

  Neuroscience (IIT affiliation) at the CiMec (Center for Mind and Brain science, University of Trento, Italy).
  Her PhD project aims to study functional connectivity in newborn infants with graph theoretical analysis.
  She will use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive method for the study of brain function, 
  and she will develop a generative model to elucidate the principles that govern the evolution of 
  functional connectivity networks during early life.'

  Giulia Scuppa graduated in Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Technology and received her PhD in pharmacology at the University of Camerino. Her doctoral research was mainly focused on unravelling the neurobiological mechanisms underlying drug addiction. She is now working on an in-vivo project to study the impact of chronic alcohol exposure on brain functional connectivity in rodents in order to identify novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of alcohol dependence.
