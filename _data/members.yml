  description: 'Angelo Bifone received a University degree from the University of Rome (Italy) in 1990, and a doctoral degree in Physics from the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa (Italy) in 1995. He conducted postdoctoral research in Berkeley (CA, USA) and Leiden (The Netherlands). From 1996 until 2001 he held the position of Lecturer in Magnetic Resonance Physics at the Institute of Cancer research of the University of London (UK). From 2001 until 2010 he was the director of the Neuroimaging Department of the Glaxo-Smith Kline Medicines Research Center in Verona (Italy). In 2010 he joined the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia as a Tenured Senior Scientist and Director of the Center for Neuroscience and Cognitive Systems. Angelo Bifone expertise is in the area of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging as applied to the study of brain function and disfunction. His group has pioneered pharmacological MRI methods to study the effects of drug intervention on brain functional activity and connectivity. His current research interests include the study of brain connectivity using graph representation and complex network analysis. Angelo Bifone published ca. 100 peer-reviewed papers in top-tier international journals, including Neuron, Nature Neuroscience and PNAS; he was awarded the Sapio Prize for MRI in 2004.'

From a computer science background, my main research interest since my PhD (in 2006) concerns the neural basis of multisensory integration. I  have  used  several  non invasive  brain  imaging to investigate these  processes  in  the  human  brain and specialized in developing toolbox to analyse fMRI ( retinotopy, bMode intersubject synchronization...). Recently, my interest has been oriented to functional connectivity in resting state and a possible disruption of it in people presenting connectopathies (Schizophrenia, Drug addiction...)'

  Neuroscience (IIT affiliation) at the CiMec (Center for Mind and Brain science, University of Trento, Italy).
  Her PhD project aims to study functional connectivity in newborn infants with graph theoretical analysis.
  She will use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive method for the study of brain function, 
  and she will develop a generative model to elucidate the principles that govern the evolution of 
  functional connectivity networks during early life.'
