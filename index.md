We are a research line of the [Center for Neuroscience and Cognitive Systems](https://beta.iit.it/centers/cncs-unitn) hosted at the [Cimec, University of Trento].

The Center for Neuroscience and Cognitive Systems (CNCS) of IIT@UniTn focuses on a multidisciplinary approach to understanding the computational abilities of the brain.

# Research
Neuroimaging data can be represented in terms of networks, or graphs, with anatomically or functionally defined districts representing the nodes, and the edges reflecting a measure of similarity or connectivity between different brain regions. The BraiNets lab leverages recent developments in graph theory and statistical physics to unravel structural and topological features of complex brain networks.

Specific problems we are tackling include the:

1. investigation of the modular structure of brain functional and structural connectivity beyond the resolution limit that affects current graph partitioning methods;
2. classification of connector hubs, i.e. brain regions responsible for the integration of brain activity;
3. identification of connectivity-based markers of neurological and psychiatric disease;
4. study of the interplay between structural and functional connectivity;
5. investigation of the inception of functional connectivity networks in newborn babies.

# Problems we are currently investigating
Specific problems we are tackling at the moment include the:

- investigation of the modular structure of brain functional and structural connectivity beyond the resolution limit that affects current graph partitioning methods;
- identification and classification of connector hubs, i.e. brain regions responsible for the integration of brain activity;
- comparison of brain networks in healthy subjects and patients to identify connectivity-based markers of neurological and psychiatric disease;
- study of the interplay between structural and functional connectivity, particularly in the presence of severe alterations of white matter structure;
- investigation of the inception of functional connectivity networks in newborn babies.
